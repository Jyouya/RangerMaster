# RangerMaster
Windower Addon for multiboxing rangers and corsairs

Actions are executed on all boxes that have the addon loaded other than the one the command is input on

Commands:

//rm shoot -- all other boxes target what the sender is targetting and perform a ranged attack.
  The addon will attempt to perform the attack repeatedly until it receives the 'ra finish' packet.
  
//rm ws -- all other boxes perform trueflight/leaden salute on the sender's target.

//rm multishot -- all other boxes perform Triple Shot or Double Shot
